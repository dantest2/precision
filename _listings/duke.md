Duke Medicine is the first medical center to deploy a SMART-compatible app in a production setting within an Epic-based EHR. The organization has integrated other apps into its proof-of-concept environment and is currently working to add write-support as well as patient-facing authentication to support SMART apps in the patient portal.
